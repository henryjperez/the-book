We will have a Discord server and a subReddit and those source of thing. I don't think that I'm going to use Slack for the limitation that it has regarding to the space size and also because there is no need for it considering that I will use Discord. Maybe an integration by webhook, wheter by only github or seeing if the gitbook has some source of api or webhooks to use.
